## CHANGELOG ENTRIES

### 2026-09-30 — Project Control Documents Setup
- **Phase / Task:** SETUP
- **Change:** 
  1. Created `/doc` directory to house all authoritative project management and governance documents.
  2. Preserved the frozen authoritative master development roadmap at `doc/HEALTH_TRACKER_MASTER_ROADMAP.md` (verified identical via SHA-256).
  3. Created the continuous, strictly anti-hallucination task tracker at `doc/HEALTH_TRACKER_TASK_TRACKER.md` tracking all 46 tasks across 20 phases.
  4. Created the executive project progress dashboard at `doc/HEALTH_TRACKER_PROGRESS.md` detailing current state, milestone progress, and codebase discrepancies.
  5. Created this changelog at `doc/HEALTH_TRACKER_CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Reason:** 
  Establish strict governance, task dependency tracking, and anti-hallucination controls before modifying any application source code or beginning Phase 0.
- **Files Affected:**
  - `doc/HEALTH_TRACKER_MASTER_ROADMAP.md`
  - `doc/HEALTH_TRACKER_TASK_TRACKER.md`
  - `doc/HEALTH_TRACKER_PROGRESS.md`
  - `doc/HEALTH_TRACKER_CHANGELOG.md`
- **Verification:**
  - `HEALTH_TRACKER_MASTER_ROADMAP.md` SHA-256 checksum verified (`6A0F8CD359F76C1A5ADC49677C28BBA7AC458723195C4CB8D9168FA8B6D0B9AF`).
  - Audited existing repository files (`src/models/`, `src/routes/`, `src/app.js`, `src/server.js`, `src/seed/`, `tests/`) to verify actual repository baseline.
  - Verified no application source files (`src/*`, `package.json`, etc.) were modified or committed in this setup step.
  - Git commit staged only `doc/` files and pushed to remote `origin/main`.
